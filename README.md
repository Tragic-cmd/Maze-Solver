# Maze Solver

This is an automatic maze generator and solver built in python using the tkinker library. 

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tragic-cmd/Static-Site-Generator.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd repo-name

# Install required dependencies
tkinker
```

## Usage

```bash
# Command to start the project
python3 main.py
```

You can customize the maze or the size of the GUI by editing the contents of main.py and constants.py.

## Features

- Generates a grid shape pattern on the screen.
- Renders a maze through the grid pattern.
- Solves the maze using recursion.

## Ideas for Extending the Project

- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Make much larger mazes to solve
- Make it a game where the user chooses directions
- If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
- Make it 3 dimensional
- Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
